The aircraft flew for a total of 41 hours with the inoperative generator passing through airports that had the facilities to repair the generator. Soon after taking off, the crew reported a fire warning in the No. 1 engine and shut it down as required. For reasons that could not be determined, shutting down the No. 1 engine and it‚Äôs generator tripped the No.2 generator resulting in the loss of all electrical power in the aircraft. Following loss of all electrical power, the battery standby electrical system either was not activated or failed to function. Electrical power at a voltage level of approximately 50 volts was restored approximately a minute and a half after loss of the No. 2 generator. The duration of this power restoration was just 9 to 15 seconds. Regardless, the pilots did not have functioning attitude indicators from the time the No. 2 generator tripped. In the dark, with no outside or inside reference to guide them, the pilots became spatially disoriented and the plane eventually went into a dive and crashed into the Pacific Ocean 11.3 miles west of the airport and sank in 950 ft. of water. The accident was caused by the loss of attitude orientation during a night, instrument departure in which all attitude instruments were disabled by loss of electrical power. The investigation was not able to determine (a) why all generator power was lost or (b) why the standby electrical power system either was not activated or failed to function."" One unproven scenario that is not contradicted by available evidence was the inadvertent placement of the battery switch to the ""OFF"" position by the flight engineer during attempts to remove galley loads from the generator buses.

Then crew then advised ATC that the engine fire was out. On final for Runway 24, the crew advised ATC that the left engine was again on fire. The landing gear was extended on short final, and when the aircraft was over the runway, the left wing broke upwards. The fuselage inverted, struck the runway and slid 2,500 feet and came to rest on the left side of the runway.  PC: The crew did not realize that the pull to the left and the extended take-off run were due to the left brakes' dragging, which led to overheating of the brake components. The dragging caused overheating and leakage, probably at one of the piston seals that retain the brake hydraulic fluid. When hydraulic fluid leaked onto the hot brake components, the fluid caught fire and initiated an intense fire in the left nacelle, leading to failure of the main hydraulic system. When the L WING OVHT light went out, the overheating problem appeared corrected; however, the fire continued to burn. The crew never realized that all of the problems were associated with a fire in the wheel well, and they did not realize how serious the situation was.

At 22.03 the aircraft was descending to 4000 ft. on final approach.  At 22.05 the captain reported reaching the minimum descent altitude and stated he could see the ground. Shortly after, the radio altimeter reported 500 ft. agl, followed by a ""minimum"" warning. A go-around was ordered, but it was too late and the aircraft struck trees and crashed. American pop singer, Melanie Thornton, 34, killed. Maria Serano Serano and Nathaly van het Ende both 27, and members of the pop-music trio, Passion Fruit, also killed. The pilot had been working more than 13 hours when the accident took place and had also exceeded maximum duty several times in the days preceding the crash. A controlled flight into terrain caused by the captain deliberately descending below the minimum descent altitude without having the required visual contact with either the approach lights or the runway and the copilot making no attempt to prevent the continuation of the flight below the minimum descent altitude. The report revealed that the pilot had failed to perform correct navigation and landing procedures before, but no action had been taken by the airline.

After a slow recovery, it climbed away to between 100 - 150 ft and then went into a turn to the left with the port propeller windmilling. This turn continued to get steeper until the aircraft rolled over and dived inverted to the ground . The accident was caused by failure of the pilot to execute a successful single engine forced landing after concluding that there had been a power loss in the port engine. Evidence indicated that a failure of the port engine did not, in fact, occur. The pre-take-off rudder trimmer check was not carried out correctly as laid down in the checklist, and the aircraft took off with full left rudder trim applied.
